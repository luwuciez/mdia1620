"Aha" Moments
----------
1. Sonja has two dogs named Billie and Teeny
2. Teaching a robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is very difficult
3. Discord uses markdown language!

Things that are still unclear
----------
1. What breed are Sonja's dogs? -> They are a toy Australian Shepherd and a miniature Australian Shepherd
2. What is the plastic clip that holds the bread bag closed called? -> It's called a bag clip

One word for how you're feeling
