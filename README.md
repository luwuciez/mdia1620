3 Things I learned
----------
1. Arrays in javascript are initialized using square brackets.
2. Elements can be pushed to and popped from an array.
3. The "=>" in a function means there's no need for a return statement. Kind of like void in Java functions.

3 Things I'm still unclear about
----------
1. If I have an array of arrays, how would I access the values in the inner array?
2. If I want to access a specific element in the array (not the first nor last element), how would I do it?
3. No more questions, everything in the lesson was very clear to me.

Analogy
----------
I've always found the analogy of stacks of pancakes and lineups/queues to be helpful for understanding arrays.
