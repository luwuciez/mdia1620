"Aha" Moments
----------
1. Sonja has two dogs named Billie and Teeny
2. Teaching a robot to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is very difficult
3. Discord uses markdown language!

Things that are still unclear
----------
1. What happens if changes are made both locally and in origin/main?
2. What's the difference between git pull, git merge, and git rebase?

One word for how you're feeling
